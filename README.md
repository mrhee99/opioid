# Evolution of Opioid Overdose Death in the US

### Research Question: ***How has the opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. progressed from 1999 to 2019 by sex and race?***

For my final project, I decided to analyze the evolution of the opioid overdose in the United States from 1999 to 2019 and delve deeper into comparing the drug overdose of varying races and sex. I will be using data visualization and data processing along with comprehensive python tools to drive the result to answer the research question.
